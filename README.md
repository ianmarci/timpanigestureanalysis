# Timpani Gesture Analysis

Project to visualize and classify different musical articulations of a timpani player. My current research involves studying the differences in gesture of the dominant and non-dominant hand of percussionists. This code will be expanded to assist me in the analysis for my Master's thesis: Handedness in Percussion Performance.

## Getting Started

The project is written using Python 3.5.4 and has not yet been made backwards compatible. The following libraries are required:

'''numpy matplotlib'''
